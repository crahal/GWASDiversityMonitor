  <h1>About</h1>
  <p> This interactive dashboard monitors the diversity of participants across all <it>published</it> Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), the primary technique used for genetic discovery. The objective is to identify statistical associations between a set of genetic variants across different individuals (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, or 'SNPs') with specific traits of interest. This monitor represents an extension of our earlier project, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0261-x">'The Scientometrics of Genome Wide Association Studies'</a> published in <i>Communications Biology</i> in January 2019. As there, we leverage the magnificent dataset provided and curated by the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/">NHGRI-EBI Catalog</a> (subject to their licensing information which can be found <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/terms-of-use">here</a>). The dashboard itself is written in <a href="http://www.google .com">Bokeh 1.2.0</a>, an interactive visualization library in Python which targets modern web browsers for presentation. The source code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/crahal/GWASDiversityMonitor">GitHub</a>, and we are actively encouraging community-based suggestions and contributions. The backend code checks daily for updates to the GWAS Catalog, writing to logs and caching all new files and refreshing the dataset which powers the dashboard as appropriate. The dashboard itself is hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> (a PaaS). The dashboard is under constant development and review, but is currently comprised of five widgets: 'Evaluation Metric' (whether the data is aggregated based on the number of studies or percent of participants), <a href="https://github.com/crahal/gwasdiversitymonitor/blob/master/data/support/dict_replacer_broad.tsv">'Broader Ancestry'</a> (grouped into one of six major ancestral categories), <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/api/search/downloads/trait_mappings">'Parent Term'</a> (grouped into 17 main EFO categories such as 'Digestive System Disease' or 'Cancer'), 'Research Stage' (whether the study concerns initial genetic discovery or replicating those discoveries), 'Year' (related to year of study). Due to the relatively small size of the dataset, not all widgets apply to each figure, and we describe our design choices below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <p><b> Figure 1: Ancestry over time by Parent Term (Bubble Plot).</b> This provides a granular overview of all GWAS in the Catalog. It maps onto EFO Parent terms, and splits on commas. If a GWAS examines multiple Parent terms, both are included (i.e., we split on commas in a string such as 'Body Measurement, Cancer' and include both). Applicable widgets are: 'Year', 'Broader Term', 'Parent Term' and 'Research Stage'.</p></li>
    <li> <p><b> Figure 2: Research Stage across all EFO Parent Categories by Ancestry (Time Series Plot).</b> This figure displays changes in how 'Broader Ancestry' has changed over time across the two 'Evaluation Metric' widgets. Note: due to the fact that that lesser studied ancestries are rarely used to study specific parent terms, we do not utilize the 'Parent Term' widget here. Fig 2a represents results when we drop all Catalog rows containing data in part not recorded, and Fig 2b includes them.</p></li>
    <li> <p><b> Figure 3: : Participants by Parent Term and Research Stage (Doughnut Chart).</b> This figure displays the percent of which 'Broader Ancestry' is used to study which 'Parent Term' across the two definitions of the 'Evaluation Metric'.</p></li>
    <li> <p><b> Figure 4: Choropleth Map. </b> Due to the sparsity of countries recruited from across all EFO Parent terms, this figure draws from two widgets: the 'Evaluation Metric' and the 'Year' slider which determines year of recruitment. This is also partially due to the lack of clarity in the free-text of academic articles which are catalogued by the NHGRI-EBI.</p></li>
    <li> <p><b> Figure 5: Free text Ancestry definition by Parent Term and Research Stage (Horizontal Bar Plot).</b> This figure extracts ancestral terms from the free text description of a study provided by the Catalog using a regex function as per our <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0261-x">scientometric review</a>. Applicable widgets are: 'Parent Term', 'Research Stage' and 'Year'.</p></li>
